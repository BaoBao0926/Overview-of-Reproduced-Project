This depository is to give an overview for the projects reproduced by me and give my brief thought

### 1.Capsule Network

The idea of Capsule network is very novel. Change commonly used scalar into vector and hence proposing algorithm, Dynamic Routing. In my opinion, the Dynamic routing is powerful for feature extraction. But training CapsNet is costly.

### 2.U-Net

U-Net is used in segmentation task. The architecture is relatively simple, therefore suitable for new begineers to start learning how to deal with segmentation task.

### 3.Learning without forgetting

Learning withou forgetting (LwF) is used to deal with continual learning task and classification. It can be regared as the most simple way to use Knowledge Distillation (KD) into continual learning area. This project is very suitable for new begineers who want to learn continual learning using KD.
